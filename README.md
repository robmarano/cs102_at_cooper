## Instructions

Write each program assignment below in C then in Python3. In order to submit your individual assignment, you will simply create a text document and add the directory URL to the GitHub repository for your CS102M assignments. 

This is the GitHub Classroom link for this specific assignment: https://classroom.github.com/a/u1qoAR22

Complete the following programs for a total of 10 points for Assignment 1.

1. _(2 points in C; 2 points in Python3)_ Write a program to assign a letter grade to a numeric test result. The program's input (0-100) is a single test score, and its output is a letter grade (A through F). Assume the normal distribution of grades: 90-100 results in an 'A', 80-89 results in a 'B', 70-79 results in a 'C', 60-69 results in a 'D', and anything less than 60 results in an 'F'. For this assignment, your input data will be coded into the actual program. The execution of the code will asses a single numeric score input.

2. _(3 points in C; 3 points in Python3)_ Extend the program logic explained above by reading in a list of numeric score inputs. Read the input from the user via the terminal (use STDIN). Store the input values into an array. Then have the program print out the basic statistics of the series of values, i.e., mean (the average score), the median (the score that half the students are less than and the other half are better than), and the mode (the score the most students earned). The program must print the scores in sorted order.
